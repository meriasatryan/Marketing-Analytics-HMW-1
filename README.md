## Innovation Diffusion Analysis Based on TIME’s Best Innovations List

This project analyzes the diffusion of an innovation selected from **TIME’s Best Innovations of 2023** using the **Bass Diffusion Model**. The assignment involves estimating the model parameters based on historical data of a similar past innovation, predicting the diffusion path of the chosen innovation, and estimating the number of adopters over time.

### Assignment Overview

1. **Choose an Innovation**  
   I have chosen an innovation from the 2023 **TIME’s Best Innovations** list.  
   [https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2023/6323132/samba-robotic-toothbrush/]()

2. **Identify a Similar Innovation from the Past**  
   I have identified a similar past innovation and compared its functionality, technology, and market impact with the chosen product.  
   - Justification of the similar innovation choice provided in the report.

3. **Find Historical Data**  
   Historical data for the similar innovation was sourced from **Statista** or other credible sources.  
   - The reference for the data source is included in the report.

4. **Estimate Bass Model Parameters**  
   Using the historical data, I have estimated the following Bass Model parameters for the similar innovation:
   - **Coefficient of Innovation (p)**
   - **Coefficient of Imitation (q)**
   - **Market Potential (M)**

5. **Predict Diffusion of the Chosen Innovation**  
   Based on the Bass Model, the diffusion path of the selected 2023 innovation has been predicted.

6. **Choose a Scope (Global or Country-Specific)**  
   The diffusion is analyzed in the context of **Great Britain**, justified by available market data.

7. **Estimate the Number of Adopters by Period**  
   Using Fermi's logic and the Bass Model parameters, the number of adopters over time has been estimated and projected for future periods.

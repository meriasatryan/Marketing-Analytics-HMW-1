Oral-B has been around for a while and has built up a strong following, especially with models like the iO series that introduce new technology to make brushing smarter and more effective. Your dataset, showing the number of Oral-B users in Great Britain from 2017 to 2020, highlights how they've steadily grown by keeping up with what people want.\n",

    "In comparison, the **Samba Robotic Toothbrush** is a newer and more advanced product, offering a fully automated brushing experience. While Oral-B uses smart features to guide users, the Samba Robotic Toothbrush takes convenience to the next level by doing all the work for you. Oral-B's success shows how important it is to innovate, but the Samba Robotic Toothbrush could attract people who want an even more effortless experience. The data on Oral-Bâ€™s user growth can help predict how quickly the Samba Robotic Toothbrush might catch on in the market."
